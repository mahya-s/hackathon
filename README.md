# This is basic section. 
the step one and started project. 

in this step we work with linux and Docker to check players skills on these two and main chapters. 

### at first we want their install a WebServer as service in systemd. 

this webserver can be nginx or haproxy. 

after that the players must config log rotate on the webserver logs with any solutions they can. 

now Linux is done. we need players install Docker and start work with that. it's cool no? :/

### after Docker installation they must do 2 tasks. 

first run a dockerize redis. (no need redis cluster but if be is better.)

second build a simple CRUD application we write before and this application it's writed with golang and python. 

    they can build any one of them and run on the server.
    the Dockerfile of your application at next step help you so be careful and save that somewehre :)
